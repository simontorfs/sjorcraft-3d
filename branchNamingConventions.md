# Git Branch Naming Best Practices

Git branches play a crucial role in managing changes and developing software projects. By using consistent and descriptive names, teams can collaborate more efficiently and improve change management. Here are some best practices for naming Git branches:

## 1. Consistency

- Use a consistent format for branch names across the team.
- Establish clear rules for naming different types of branches, such as features, bug fixes, and updates.

## 2. Descriptiveness

- Ensure that the branch name describes the feature, bug, or update being addressed.
- Use understandable and concise descriptions that reflect the content of the changes.

## 3. Linking to Jira or other Ticket Numbers

- Include the corresponding Jira, GitHub Issue, or other ticket number in the branch name for traceability.
- Place the ticket number at the beginning of the branch name for quick references.

## 4. Examples of Branch Names

- **Feature branches:** `feature/JiraTicketNumber-description`
  - Example: `feature/SJOR-6-poletool`
- **Bugfix branches:** `bugfix/JiraTicketNumber-description`
  - Example: `bugfix/SJOR-12-login-issue`
- **Update branches:** `update/JiraTicketNumber-description`
  - Example: `update/SJOR-18-ui-improvements`

## 5. Avoid Unnecessary Details

- Keep the branch name concise and relevant.
- Avoid adding unnecessary information that is not pertinent to the change.
